# Vahan Bazar – Two-Wheeler Marketplace

## Problem Statement Chosen
The process of buying or selling two-wheelers online is often fragmented. Customers struggle to compare multiple models, calculate EMI or fuel costs, track upcoming launches, and book test rides. Dealerships also face challenges in managing inventory and reaching buyers digitally.  

## Detailed Proposal & Prototype Plan
**Vahan Bazar** is a web application that acts as a one-stop marketplace for two-wheelers (bikes, scooters, and EVs).  
The platform will include:  
- Advanced search and filters (brand, price, fuel type, mileage).  
- Detailed product pages with price, specs, images, and offers.  
- Side-by-side comparison of models.  
- EMI & fuel cost calculators for better financial decisions.  
- Listings for used bikes with options to sell.  
- Upcoming launches with model details and launch dates.  
- Showroom directories with integrated test ride booking forms.  

### Prototype Development Phases
1. **Phase 1:** Listings, Search & Filters, Product Page.  
2. **Phase 2:** Compare Models, EMI & Fuel Cost Calculators.  
3. **Phase 3:** Used Bikes, Showrooms, and Test Ride Booking.  
4. **Phase 4 (Optional Enhancements):**
